# 50 Shades of Lambda

People all over the internet are using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) in more and more creative ways to build all sort of useful things, ranging from infrastructure automation to deployment solutions, business intelligence to almost full fledged http endpoints and REST services respectively without running any servers.

We thought it would be a cool idea to collect and curate all of this content and write a little eBook about Lambda and all the cool use cases that people are building with it.

The book will be organized in 50 chapters with each one belonging to one category such as Infrastructure Management, Monitoring + Logging, Application Services, etc. Use-Cases and complexity will be very diverse, ranging from small (What is my IP?) to big Lambda functions (Thumbnailing), from simple (EBS Snapshot) to complex use cases (Ray-tracing high-quality images in the cloud) that involve more services.

The eBook will be free, open sourced on Github at https://github.com/arafato/50-Shades-of-Lambda and published via Leanpub at https://leanpub.com/fifty-shades-of-lambda. Any royalties will be donated.

Currently, we are collecting use cases. Everybody can contribute and submit links to blog posts, Github or any other location that is publicly available. Have a look at our [current collection](https://github.com/arafato/50-Shades-of-Lambda/blob/master/orga/resources.md) and send us a pull request. Everybody whose contribution is featured in the book will get listed as contributor in the final edition of the book.
